This project contains a collection of my personal install script which I use whe I setup a new machine. This is very much a work in progress at present.

# Usage

Copy the `private-config.exmaple.sh` to `private-config.sh` and fill in your personal details.

Run the complete fresh-install script. The script will ask which parts you would like to install.

```shell
$ ./fresh-install.sh
```

Optionally you can also use the individual install script located in the `scripts/install` directory.

```shell
$ ./scripts/install/install_<name-of-application>.sh
```
